      <p>Background:</p>
      I went to school at Oregon State where I graduated with a degree in Finance and a minor in Communications.
      I currently work a web development and consulting agency called Metal Toad where I am the Financial Analyst.
      I took this class at Epicodus so I could learn the language that my coworkers speak (or write in) and to understand our business more.
      <p>My Hobbies include:</p>
        <li>Hanging out with my friends</li>
        <li>Working out at 24hr Fitness</li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Anything that involves getting out on the water (River, Ocean, etc.)</li>
