      <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
      I went to school at Oregon State where I graduated with a degree in Finance and a minor in Communications.
      I currently work a web development and consulting agency called Metal Toad where I am the Financial Analyst.
      I took this class at Epicodus so I could learn the language that my coworkers speak (or write in) and to understand our business more.
      <p><strong>My Hobbies include:</strong></p>
